1/variance*root(2PI)   

*  e^((x-mean)^2/2*variance^2)



N = total experiments

p = prob1

q = prob2

variance = root(Npq)


root(Npq) = 60*.47*.48 = 3.67


Can't use casino on the net, they reshuffle after every hand.  Or after every few.  
In 30 hands I saw 6 Q of Hearts and 7 7 of hearts.  THose were the only 2 I counted.  
This is supposed to be out of a 4 deck chute. 

Some of the decks would be shuffled after a certain period of time. 
Can just leave the room and then come back so I have a fresh deck.

On each decision matrix, I should have a detailed percentage of the hands.  
That means if .0045% of hands are like that, that is what I should put in the matrix.  
Then put a detailed checkbox, so they can look at the decision or at the percent of hands that are like that.  
Also add a percent of hands for the total doubled and the split hands.  

Compare the win loss probability with the win loss probability of another strategy 
and show the play mistakes with that strategy and show the bet mistakes with that strategy.  
Just do a standard strategy for now and then you can implement a strategy dialog 
so that they will be able to change the strategy for the next version if there ever is any.  


Have the other players be able to play standard strategy or just a random strategy.

This should be an option.  

However the most convincing sales point is going to be personal win/loss.  

set play practice and ace practice, split practice, double practice
and bet practice.  That way
they will be able to practice tough situations.  
If ace practice they shouldn't count toward the total.  Also, double
practice would be the same way, and split.  

Maybe add all of the mistakes for one hour together and then put them into a tree or something
instead of having them all seperate.  This is a tough proposition, I dont know which will be 
better, but the thing is there can get to be too many if the person is not so good.  

Maybe show only the first 10 or so from every day or from every hour or something.  

check for mistake consistency.  Consistently twice below the approximated win.

Have the people who use the software to post findings on the forum so you have like a
centralized knowledge base about blackjack.  They can share if they want and they can 
not if they want.  

you want to enable all of the dialog functions for the pro version, make sure all of this 
is integrated with the PracticeDlg, just take out the next # from the deck.  You should have
another count as well for that, and maybe allow them to adjust the strategy.  Look at other 
strategy dialogs for this to see what you should offer.  Just do something fairly standard.
