These are improvements for the next version of the software should there be one.  

Implement the strategy writing and changing feature.  Do this for the betting strategy 
as well.  It will be quite difficult to implement different play strategies for different
counts and all that.  It could get quite confusing.

Does clicking on the mistake update the decision matrix?

How can I improve the speed of looking at the bet mistakes?
